## To Prespective Employers:
 I am a proven data professional with 9+ years in the market research industry (general merchandise/consumer goods), with a background in Operations, Analytics, and Data Science. I excel in a cross-functional environment, leveraging my leadership skills to effectively manage direct reports. Most importantly, I dedicate myself to completing long bouts of deep work to automate tasks, as well as create, design, and enhance ML techniques that have both added significant value to my current employer. 
 
 Due to this being a competitive space, I have published my portfolio for you to get a better understanding of my capabilities.

 ## Why me?
 Shortly after the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I enrolled in a 10-month long Data Science Bootcamp from Aug'20 - Jun'21. I have not stopped learning since, enhancing my knowledge and skillset by reading books and completing multiple online courses. Over the past 4 years, I have applied these skills to my work by automating reports, creating a user-friendly program for the analytics team to work out of (effectively sunsetting Tableau and Alteryx licenses), and enhancing coverage and accuracy of our ML classification of receipt-based data submitted by our panelists of consumers.

I am actively engaged in keeping up with the latest and greatest advancements in AI (that seem to be changing almost daily) and have experience running traditional ML + Deep Learning models on tabular, text, and image data. 

If you are looking for someone with a proven track record of solving complex business problems, is committed to continuously learning, and works well in a collaborative setting, I am open to new opportunities.

 ## Portfolio Projects:
 In the 'NLP_Ecommerce_Classification.ipynb' notebook, you will find the following:
 - Extensive EDA on text column 'item_description' using NLP, uncovering and visualizing relationships between words within each of the 'labels' (Household, Books, Electronics, Clothing & Accessories) of the e-commerce dataset
 - ML techniques for classification i.e. LinearSVC, MultiNomialNB, and Neural Networks
 - Evaluation and improvement of models <br>
   *Added note - this is not meant to show production ready code, rather a notebook to give a quick glimpse into a small window of my capabilties


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
